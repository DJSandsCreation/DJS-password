In Mission 2 you are going to learn how to code in a new programming language called JavaScript. JavaScript allows you to build web pages that are interactive, which means they respond to the user. In this mission you are first going to learn how to use hyperlinks to connect two web pages together to create a simple website.

Then you are going to learn how to create JavaScript programs that will run in your web browser. In the final Do It Yourself Task you will use your JavaScript skills to create a program that checks a userâ€™s password. If the user enters the correct password, they will be taken to the Monk Diamond web page. If they get the password wrong, they will get an alert telling them that access has been denied.
